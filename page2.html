<h1>My Job</h1>
<p>

    My boss, Betty Mccarty, is wonderful to work for.

<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>
    What I do while I am working is run the shop. I open the shop at eleven in the morning and
    I spend the day tagging new clothes that people bring in. I am the cashier as well and I also go
    around the store and organize the clothes we have out for people to purchase, and I clean. While
    I am working, everything that goes on, every interaction, purchase, question, I deal with myself.
