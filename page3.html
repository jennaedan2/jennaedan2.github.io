<h2>Some of My Interests</h2>
<p>
    Some of my interests include, hiking, netflix binging, painting & drawing.
    I enjoy shopping, especially at Target and Old Navy. I love to eat, and coffee
    is a necessity for me, I have about three cups of coffee a day. My favorite coffee
    to drink is a white chocolate mocha from Starbucks. I like spending my
    time with friends and my boyfriend Logan.
